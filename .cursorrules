You are an AI coding agent working in this repo. Follow these React conventions for styles and pages.

General
- Prefer small, composable components with clear responsibilities.
- Keep side effects out of render. Put effects in hooks and keep dependency arrays correct.
- Do not introduce unused dependencies. Prefer built-in APIs and small utilities.

Project structure (pages and UI)
- Put route-level components in src/pages. Each page should coordinate data, routing, and composition.
- Put reusable UI pieces in src/components. Keep them presentational when possible.
- If a feature has multiple components, hooks, and helpers, group it in src/features/<featureName>/.
- Put shared layouts in src/layouts (or keep a Layout component next to pages if small).
- Keep pages thin: move heavy logic to hooks (src/hooks) and helpers (src/lib).
- Prefer named exports for shared components and utilities. Use default exports for route pages only.

Routing
- Use React Router with a route config and nested layouts when the app grows.
- Prefer code splitting on routes (lazy + Suspense) for larger apps.
- Add error boundaries for route-level failures.

Styling (preferred order)
1) CSS Modules for component-scoped styles (default).
2) Plain CSS with strict scoping (only for truly global rules like a CSS reset).
3) Inline styles only for tiny one-off values or dynamic styles that would be awkward in CSS.

Styling rules
- ALL styles live in src/styles/. Do not put CSS files alongside components or pages.
- Global styles and CSS variables go in src/styles/global.css.
- CSS Modules are named ComponentName.module.css and live in src/styles/.
- Prefer CSS Modules over inline styles. Inline styles are allowed only for truly dynamic values (e.g., width based on a prop) or 1-2 one-off declarations.
- Avoid global selectors that leak (no styling bare h1, button, a globally unless it is a reset).
- Use CSS variables for theme tokens: colors, spacing, radius, shadows, z-index.
- Prefer rem for typography and spacing. Use px for hairlines only.
- Keep animation subtle and respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Do not add a CSS framework unless asked. If you add one, document it in README.

CSS Modules conventions
- Name module files `ComponentName.module.css` and place them in src/styles/.
- Use `camelCase` class names in CSS Modules so `styles.someClass` matches naturally.
- Avoid deeply nested selectors; keep modules component-scoped and shallow.

Pages and state
- Keep state closest to where it is used.
- Avoid prop drilling across many levels. Use Context for app-level concerns only (auth, theme).
- Prefer derived state over duplicated state.
- Prefer controlled forms for complex inputs and validation.

Performance and DX
- Use memoization (useMemo/useCallback/React.memo) only after you see a real need.
- Keep keys stable when rendering lists. Do not use array index as key for reorderable lists.
- Add small, focused utilities (clsx for className composition is ok).

Edits policy
- When you change structure or styling approach, update imports and delete dead files.
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with the patterns above.
